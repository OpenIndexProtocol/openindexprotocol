# Rebalancer Module for Open Index Protocol

This module computes rebalancing actions for indexes created via [Open Index Protocol](https://github.com/openindex-protocol/open-index-core). It integrates price feeds, index vault balances, and trade execution logic.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📊 Compare index vault allocations to target composition
- 🧠 Use oracle data to detect drift
- 🔁 Trigger swaps via the Trade Module
- ✅ Finalize rebalance by updating Open Index vaults

---

## 🧩 Features

- Plug-and-play CPI architecture
- Works with Pyth or Switchboard oracles
- Callable by off-chain bots, cron schedulers, or DAOs
- Minimal dependency on core index logic (all CPI-based)

---

## 🛠 Rebalancing Flow

1. Load index composition via CPI to Open Index
2. Fetch token prices from on-chain oracles
3. Determine target vs actual value per token
4. Construct trade instructions and route via Trade Module
5. Call Open Index to update vault state post-rebalance

---

## 🔬 Development

```bash
cargo test-bpf
````

You may simulate rebalancing strategies off-chain for modeling before deployment.
