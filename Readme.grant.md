Here’s a production-ready `README.md` you can use for your GitHub organization repo (e.g., `openindex-protocol/open-index-core`). This version aligns with the grant proposal, positions the project as public-good infrastructure, and invites contributors or DAOs to build on it.

````markdown
# Open Index Protocol

**Solana-native index fund protocol** for creating and managing tokenized baskets of SPL assets.  
Modular, composable, and built for DAOs and DeFi automation.

---

## 🌐 Overview

Open Index Protocol allows anyone to create, mint, and redeem on-chain index tokens backed by a basket of SPL assets.  
Inspired by protocols like Index Coop on Ethereum, this implementation is optimized for Solana’s speed, fees, and composability.

---

## ✅ Core Features

- 📦 **Index Creation** – Permissionless creation of index tokens with custom components
- 🪙 **Mint / Redeem** – Token holders can mint or redeem index tokens for proportional underlying assets
- ♻️ **Vault System** – SPL tokens are stored securely using PDAs
- 🔌 **Modular Design** – Trade and Rebalancer modules can be plugged in via `init_module` to handle execution and strategy
- 🧠 **DAO-Ready** – Future support for governance-managed indexes and controller-level access control
- 🧰 **Developer SDK** – TypeScript bindings and CLI coming soon

---

## 🛠 Architecture

- `Protocol`: Global state anchor for the system
- `Controller`: Manages multiple indexes; enables DAO-like control
- `Index`: Represents an individual token basket
- `Components`: Metadata for each asset in the index
- `Vaults`: PDAs holding the actual SPL tokens
- `Modules`: Pluggable programs (e.g. TradeModule, RebalanceModule) that can call back into Open Index

## 🧪 Getting Started (Test Environment)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openindex-protocol/open-index-core
cd open-index-core
cargo build-bpf
````

You can run tests via:

```bash
cargo test-bpf
```

Devnet deployment and SDK setup coming soon.

---

## 🧬 Modules

This protocol supports registering additional Solana programs using `init_module`.
These modules can:

* Fetch index data
* Use oracles to assess drift
* Execute rebalances via CPI
* Register DAO strategies

Current planned modules:

* 🔁 `TradeModule` – Route token swaps via DEX CPI (Jupiter, Phoenix)
* 📊 `RebalanceModule` – Calculate and trigger rebalances using oracle feeds

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Open Index Protocol is a public good.
We're looking for contributors to help build:

* Governance layer
* SDK + CLI tooling
* UI demo app
* New modules for rewards, auto-rebalancing, etc.

Would you like me to create a second version specifically for the `Trade Module` or `Rebalance Module` repos?
